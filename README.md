# ml_notification_system
I commonly do a lot of ML on hosted servers, but since I'm a student, I can't always spend time on them, or put a lot of money on a nice machine. As a result, my code commonly crashes, but I don't know until days later. This permits me to create a notification system alerting me when things crash, and I can take care of it. It also provides updates on training progress when necessary.
